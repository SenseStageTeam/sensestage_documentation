The [Getting Started](getting-started-with-sensestage) pages guide you through the process of getting set up to use the Sense/Stage MiniBees describing what is what and how to set up the software.

The [Glossary](glossary) is an overview of the terminology used throughout the documentation.

Furthermore there are different [Guides](guides) on various topics.

If you did not find what you were looking for in the documentation, you can ask your question at the [Sense/Stage forum](https://forum.sensestage.eu), or perhaps already find the answer there.

If you found a bug in anything related to Sense/Stage, you can [report it](reporting-bugs).
