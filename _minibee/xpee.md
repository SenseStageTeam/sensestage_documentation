The XPee board is a small expansion board which allows you to hook up common sensors:

* 4 resistive sensors
* 3 LEDs
* 3 digital inputs or outputs
* Two wire interface (TWI/I2C) devices
* RX/TX (for monitoring)

For the resistive sensors footprints on the board are available to solder a (fixed value) resistor to create the voltage divider with your resistive sensor.

For the LEDs there are also footprints available to solder the (fixed value) resistor to regulate the current to your LED.
