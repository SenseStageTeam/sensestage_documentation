There are many ways to contribute to the Sense/Stage project:

* [inspiring others what can be done with Sense/Stage by sharing your project](#inspire)
* [help documenting the project](#document)
* [fix issues in the hardware](#hardware)
* [fix issues in the software](#software)
* [fix issues in the firmware](#firmware)

# Documentation {#document}

These documentation pages are written in a flavour of markdown text called [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html). The pages are then rendered with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

The source files of the documentation are hosted [here]().

If you want to contribute to the documentation, you can do so in different ways:

- mail me with an updated page (the markdown file and the pictures you made that belong to the page)
- suggest an improvement for a documentation page via the forum.
- via github:
    - create a user account if you don't have one
    - file an issue on github and suggest an improvement there.
    - if you are familiar with `git`
        - create a clone of the repository
        - modify or add the file you want
        - commit it and push it to your clone
        - create a pull request

For us, it is the most convenient if a contribution is supplied via git, as it will be the least work for us to keep files in sync. But if you are not familiar with `git` we more than welcome contributions via the forum or mail.
