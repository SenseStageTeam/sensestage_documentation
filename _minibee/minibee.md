# Overview of the features:

* 6 analog inputs: A0, A1, A2, A3, A6, A7
* 8 digital inputs or outputs: D3, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11; or optional four more: A0, A1, A2, A3
* PWM (“analog”) output, at pins D3, D5, D6, D9, D10, D11
* TWI (or I2C) communication: SDA (A4), SCL (A5)
* Integrated ADXL345 – 3-axis accelerometer
* Serial I/O: RX, TX (to XBee)
* Power input (between 3.3V and 5V), through battery connector and coin cell battery
* Regulated power output: 3.3V, GND
* On/off switch
* Short circuit protection with a resetting fuse
* Status LEDs for power, association with XBee network, XBee receiving data, and configuration status
* Small footprint
* Preprogrammed with firmware for wireless configuration for using many common sensors
* Firmware communication with software data sharing network supported by many common interactive software environments (e.g. SuperCollider, Max/MSP, PureData, Processing).
