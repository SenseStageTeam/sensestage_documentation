# Formatting the text

We use Markdown for formatting the text. This is a simple method to indicate headers, make lists, indicate that words should be italic or bold, and include links in the text.

A `#` in front of a line will make it into a header:

```
# This is a header
```

Renders to:

------------------
# This is a header
------------------

Adding more `#`'s makes subheaders:

```
## This is a subheader
### This is a sub-sub-header
```

------------------
## This is a subheader
### This is a sub-sub-header
------------------
