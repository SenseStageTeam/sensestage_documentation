There are two points on LiPo batteries that are vulnerable to being damaged when disconnecting the battery, or embedding it into a project. One is the connector itself, where the wires could potentially be pulled out of the JST connector if pulled too hard. The other is the point where the wires are soldered to the battery.

If you think your batteries will be disconnected and handled frequently, then it's a good idea to take a few precautions to add some strain relief to these two points.

## Point 1: Hot glue the connector

The point where the wires meet the connector can be improved by adding a dollop of hot glue just on top of the connector. Be careful to only glue the area where the wires meet the connector, and not the connector itself, or else you might make it difficult to insert the battery into the Minibee.

## Point 2: Support the wire with some tape

It's easy to add strain relief to the second point by using a little electrical tape to wrap the wire against the battery. Now if the wire gets yanked, the stress will be on the tape and not the delicate point where the wires are soldered to the battery.
