On the following pages you will find documentation pages for Sense/Stage v1. Note that some of these pages are still stubs, and therefore may not yet be finished. We are working steadily on improvising the Sense/Stage documentation.

However, if you have any questions, please ask them on the [Sense/Stage Forum](https://forum.sensestage.eu). And if you would like to help contribute to the documentation process, please let us know, or give the [how to contribute](general/contributing-to-the-documentation) section a read-through.

# Getting started

To get started right away, you should first read through [an overview of the Sense/Stage system](overview-of-the-system). Once you're familiar with that, proceed on to the [Getting Started Guide for New Users](getting-started-with-sense-stage/getting-started-with-sense-stage).  

You will find additional guides, technical reference pages, and download links using the navigation links in the header above.
