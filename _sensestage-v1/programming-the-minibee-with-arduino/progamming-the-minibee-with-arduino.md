In this guide, we will explain how you can use the Arduino IDE to program the MiniBees.

When you buy a MiniBee, it is preprogrammed with the bootloader and the default firmware sketch. You will only need to program firmware onto the MiniBee yourself, in case you want to [use customized firmware](../customizing-firmware) or want to update the firmware sketch to the latest version.

* [Make a connection between the MiniBee and the coordinator board](connecting-the-minibee-and-coordinator-board)
* [Prepare the Arduino IDE with firmware libraries and hardware definitions](prepare-the-arduino-ide)
* [Uploading firmware to a MiniBee](uploading-firmwware-to-a-minibee)
* [Programming the bootloader](programming-the-bootloader) - in case you happen to have a MiniBee with no bootloader
