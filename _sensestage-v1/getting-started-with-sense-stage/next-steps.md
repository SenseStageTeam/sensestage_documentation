# Next steps {#step4}

Now that you have a network up and running, the next step is to connect the OSC data coming from Pydon to other software that will do something with this data. Most creative coding and interactive design platforms have some way of receiving and sending OSC data.

A good place to start is the [examples folder in the Pydon software package](https://github.com/sensestage/ssdn_python/tree/master/examples) with has some basic examples for interfacing Sense/Stage with common creative software packages.

You should also look through the [OSC message reference](/sensestage-v1/osc-message-reference/) to get an idea of what OSC messages are send to and from Pydon.

Finally, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of the [Pydon configuration file](/sensestage-v1/configuration-file/), so that you are able to configure your MiniBees to use custom sensors.
