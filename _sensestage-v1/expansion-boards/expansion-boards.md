Various expansion boards are available for attaching to your Minibees. These expansion boards are small printed circuit boards that connect easily into the expansion headers of the Minibee to allow you some space to add additional sensors, hardware and circuitry.

Currently there are three expansion boards available.
* The [Xpee](xpee), a small expansion board useful for resistive sensors and simple actuators like LEDs.
* The [XPree](xpree), a larger expansion board that breaks out all the pins of the Minibee on to a general purpose prototyping board.
* The [MiniLily](minilily), an expansion board designed to be used in wearable projects, featuring pin-breakouts that can be sewn to using conductive thread.
